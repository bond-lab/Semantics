\myslide{Idioms and Metaphors}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many phrases have meanings that cannot be predicted from the meanings of the individual words
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{take into one's confidence}
  \item \eng{take in}
  \item \eng{Sherlock Holmes}
  \item \eng{practical joke(r)}
  \item \eng{in love}
  \end{itemize}
\item Metaphors extend the use of words beyond their primary meaning
  to describe referents that bear similarities to the word's primary
  referent.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{"Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and  and at least \ul{throw a little light} through \ul{the dense darkness which surrounds me}"}
\end{exe}
\begin{center}
UNDERSTANDING is LIGHT \\ = \\ IGNORANCE is DARKNESS
\end{center}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{We interpret words in \txx{context}}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1.5ex}
%\item It isn't only deictic expressions that require context
\item For example, in a bookshop
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Have you got the new \ul{C.J. Cherryh}?} \textnormal{``book by $\sim$''}
  \end{exe}
\item In a snooker (pool)  game
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{I have two \ul{reds} left} ``red balls''
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{metonymy}: substituting the name of an attribute or feature for the name of the thing itself
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{\ul{The ham sandwich} is at table three} ``person who ordered $\sim$''
    \ex \eng{I spent all morning with \ul{the suits}} ``person who
    habitually wears $\sim$''\footnote{ A person who wears matching
      jacket and trousers, especially a boss or a supervisor (pejorative)}
  \end{exe}
  \item \txx{synecdoche}: substituting the name of a part for the name of a thing \\
    (a kind of metonymy)
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{We need some more willing \ul{hands}} ``person with $\sim$''
  \end{exe}
\item[?] Give examples of metonymy and synechdoche\task

\end{itemize}


\myslide{All knowledge is context}
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{1.5ex}
\item Knowledge to interpret utterances can come from multiple sources
  \begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{1ex}
  \item \txx{Deixis}: The physical context of the utterance
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \eng{My stepdaughter has been \ul{here}. I have traced her.} ``221B Baker Street'' \sh{SPEC}
    \end{itemize}

  \item \txx{Discourse}: What has already been said
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \eng{The dog$_i$ chased the cat$_j$.  Eventually it$_i$ caught it$_j$.}
    \item \eng{My stepdaughter$_i$ has been here. I have traced her$_i$.} \sh{SPEC}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \txx{World knowledge}: Background and common knowledge
   \begin{itemize}
    \item \eng{I would like to go to the moon.} ``the Earth's moon''
    \end{itemize}

  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Context can complete fragments}
\begin{itemize}
\item In a dialogue, we often only add new knowledge
  \begin{exe}
    \ex 
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex \eng{Who moved these chairs?}
      \ex \eng{Sandy (did) [move these chairs]}
  \end{xlist}

  \begin{xlist}
   \ex \eng{'What is it, then? [Is it] A fire?'}
   \ex \eng{'No [it is not], [It is] a client.  \ldots} \hfill \sh{SPEC}
 \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\item Normally English requires a complete sentence, 
\item[\ldots] but here a \txx{fragment} is OK
\end{itemize}

\section{Conversational Implicature}


\myslide{Cooperation in Conversation}
\MyLogo{\citet{Grice:1975}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Cooperative Principle}: people cooperate in conversation
  \begin{quote}
    ``Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.''
  \end{quote}
\item \txx{Implicature}
  \begin{quote}
    The aspect of meaning that a speaker conveys, implies, or suggests
    without directly expressing.
  \end{quote}
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Did you do the reading?}
    \ex \eng{I meant to.}
    \trans \textnormal{Implicates: No}
  \end{exe}

\end{itemize}

\myslide{Gricean Maxims}
\MyLogo{\citet{Grice:1975}}
\begin{description}
\item [\txx{Maxim of Quantity}] ~
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).
  \item Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
  \end{itemize}
\item [\txx{Maxim of Quality}] ~
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Do not say what you believe to be false.
  \item Do not say that for which you lack proper evidence.
  \end{itemize}
\newpage
\item [\txx{Maxim of Relation}] ~
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Be relevant.
  \end{itemize}
\item [\txx{Maxim of Manner}] ~
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Be perspicuous [= be easily understood]\footnote{A
      philosopher's joke.}
  \item Avoid obscurity of expression.
  \item Avoid ambiguity
  \item Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity)
  \item Be orderly
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\myslide{An Example of implicature}

Speech that seems to violate the maxims will evoke \txx{implicatures}
(inferences about the reason why the speaker violated the maxim(s)).
This is because the hearer assumes the speaker is acting in accordance
with the Cooperative Principle, and is rational.
\begin{exe}
  \ex A: \eng{Can you tell me the time?}
  \trans Lit: Do you have the ability to tell me the time?
  \ex B: \eng{ Well, the school bus just left.}
  \trans Lit.: The school bus left prior to the time of speaking.
\end{exe}
\newpage
What is meant:
\begin{itemize}
\item [A] Do you have the ability to tell me the time of the present moment, as standardly indicated on a watch, and if so, please do so tell me what time it is.
\item [B] No, I don't know the exact time of the present moment, but I can provide some information from which you may be able to deduce the approximate time, namely the school bus usually leaves at a specific, regular time (e.g., 8:00am)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item [A] flouted Manner --- why not request that you are told the time?
\item [B] flouted Relation --- what does this have to do with the time?
\end{itemize}

A assumes B is being cooperative, so the response must somehow be helpful; this triggers the implicature.


\myslide{Various Conversational Implicatures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes no special knowledge is required in the context to
  calculate the additional conveyed meaning 
  (\txx{Generalized Conversational Implicatures})
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Did you bring the flowers and the card?}
    \ex \eng{I brought the card.}
    \trans \textnormal{Implicature: but not the flowers.}
  \end{exe}
\item 
Most of our conversations take place in very specific contexts in
which locally recognized inferences are assumed. 
(\txx{Particularized Conversational Implicatures})

\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{Hey Terry, are you coming to the party tonight?}
  \ex \eng{My parents are visiting.} ``So I am busy/So I have a babysitter''
\end{exe}
\item All implicatures are \txx{defeasible}: they can be canceled
without a contradiction.

\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{But I can still come.}
\end{exe}
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Scalar Implicatures}
\MyLogo{Extended into the Horn Scale: classic example is numbers}
\newcommand{\horn}[1]{\ensuremath{\langle}\,#1\,\ensuremath{\rangle}}
\newcommand{\set}[1]{\{#1\}}

Certain information is communicated by choosing a word which
expresses one value from a scale of values. 

\begin{exe}
  \ex	$\langle$ \eng{all, most, many, some, few} $\rangle$
  \ex	$\langle$ \eng{always, often, sometimes} $\rangle$
\end{exe}

We should choose the word from the scale which is the most informative
and truthful in the circumstances (Quantity and Quality).  Words on
the scale implicate the negation of words on their left: 

\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{I'm doing a major in Linguistics and I've completed some of the required subjects}
  \ex \eng{They are often late.}
  \ex	\eng{I got some of these antiques in London – hang on, actually I think I got most of them 	there.} \hfill (defeasible)
\end{exe}

\myslide{Horn Scales}
%\MyLogo{\url{http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~mu65qev/wikolin/index.php?title=Horn_scale&redirect=no}}
 To form a
Horn scale \horn{$S,W$}, two words ($S$ and $W$) must satisfy the following
conditions:
\begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-2ex}
\item[(i)] $A(S)$ must entail $A(W)$ for some arbitrary sentence frame $A$;
\item[(ii)] $S$ and $W$ must be equally lexicalized;
\item[(iii)] $S$ and $W$ must be about the same semantic relations, or
  from the same semantic field. 
\end{enumerate}
  \begin{itemize}
\item Words on the scale implicate the negation of words on their left
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \horn{\eng{always, often, sometimes}}.
  \item \horn{\eng{\ldots, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}}.
  \item \horn{\eng{hot, warm, lukewarm, cold}}.
  \item \horn{\eng{the},  \set{\eng{a},\eng{some}}}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



% \myslide{Conventional Implicatures}
% \MyLogo{}

% Conventional implicatures are non-truth conditional inferences that
% are not derived from superordinate pragmatic principles like the
% [Gricean] maxims, but are simply attached by convention to particular
% lexical items.

% They are non-cancellable:
% \begin{exe}
%   \ex
%   \begin{xlist}
%     \ex \eng{She was poor, but honest.}
%     \ex \eng{*She was poor but honest, and was in fact rich.}
%   \end{xlist}
% \end{exe}

\myslide{Flouting the maxims}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantity:	(In answer to \eng{Tell me all about him!}:) 
  \eng{He has a nice personality.}
\item Quality:	(In response to something stupid someone did:) 
  \eng{That was brilliant!}
\item Relation:	(In response to \eng{Can I go out and play?}:) 
\eng{Did you finish your homework?}
\item Quality:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{My car breaks down every five minutes} \hfill hyperbole

%% FIXME add some manner flouting

\myslide{What happens when we flout?}
\begin{itemize}
\item If someone doesn't understand this, (e.g. someone from another
  culture), then what was originally intended to be a metaphor may
  result in a \txx{lie}.
\item We may flout: 
  \begin{itemize}
\item Quantity: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item say  more than we need to indicate a sense of occasion, or respect
  \item  say less than we need, in order to be blunt, or rude
  \end{itemize}
\item Quality: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item white lies
  \end{itemize}
\item Relation  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item to signal embarrassment
  \item to change the subject
  \end{itemize}

  \item[A1] There must exist an accepted conventional procedure that
    includes saying certain words by certain persons in certain
    circumstances,
  \item[A2] The circumstances must be appropriate for the invocation
  \item[B1] All participants must do it both correctly
  \item[B2] \ldots  and completely
  \item[C1] The intention must be to do this the act
  \item[C2] The participants must conduct themselves so subsequently.
  \end{description}
\item If the conditions don't hold, the speech act is \txx{infelicitous}

\eng{OK} (in response to \eng{Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
the truth?} – wrong formula)
\item \textbf{B2}
\eng{I bet you \$50 the opposition loses the next election} (infelicitous without a response: \eng{OK – you're on}; Austin calls the required response uptake)

\section{Summary of Semantics and Pragmatics}

\myslide{The big picture}
\begin{itemize} 
\item We can do many things with words
  \begin{itemize} \addtolength{\itemsep}{1ex}
  \item Convey information
  \item Express attitudes
  \item Ask someone to do something
  \item Commit to doing something
  \item Change the state of the world (performatives)
  \end{itemize}
\newpage
\item We do this by building layers of inference (pragmatics) on top
  of our understanding of words and how they go together (semantics)
  \begin{itemize} \addtolength{\itemsep}{0.5ex}
  \item Words have meanings, that can be described through semantic relations
  \item Words describe referents and situations, and can also show the
    speaker's attitudes
  \item Relations between participants in a situation are linked by semantic roles
  \item Sometimes word meaning is non-compositional, it comes from constructions
  \item The scope of reference can be changed by quantifiers and modification
  \item Utterances are interpreted in context
  \item We assume a cooperative partner
  \item And we care about each others face! ~~~~ \PF{1} \& \NF{1}
  \item Different languages and cultures do this differently

  \end{itemize}
\item A skilled writer can use words to tell a story, \ldots
