\section{Revision: \\ Sentence Relations and Truth}

\myslide{Logic}

\begin{itemize}
\item Classical logic is an attempt to find valid principles of argument and inference.
\\[2ex]
\begin{tabular}{llr}
  $a$ & If something is human then it is mortal & \txx{premise}\\
  $b$ & Socrates is human & \txx{premise}\\ \hline
  $c$ & Socrates is mortal & \txx{conclusion}
\end{tabular}
\item Can we go from $a$ and $b$ to $c$? \hfill {\large Yes}
\item Truth is \txx{empirical}: The premises need to correspond with
  the facts of the world
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sentences have \txx{truth values} (true, false or unknown)
  \item The state of the world that makes a sentence true or false are its \txx{truth conditions}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Methods of Argument}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Modus Ponens}
\\[2ex]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $a$ & If something is human then it is mortal \\
    $b$ & Socrates is human \\ \hline
    $c$ & Socrates is mortal
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q$
\item \txx{Modus tollens}
\\[2ex]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $a$ & If something is human then it is mortal \\
    $b$ & Zeus is not mortal \\ \hline
    $c$ & Zeus is not human
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \rightarrow q, \neg q \vdash \neg p$

\newpage
\item \txx{Hypothetical syllogism}
\\[2ex]
 \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $a$ & If something is human then it is mortal \\
    $b$ & If something is mortal then it dies \\ \hline
    $c$ & If something is human then it dies
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \rightarrow q, q \rightarrow r \vdash p \rightarrow r$
\item \txx{Disjunctive syllogism}
\\ (modus tollendo ponens: affirm by denying)
\\[2ex]
 \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $p$ & Either a human is mortal or a human is immortal \\
    $q$ & A human is not immortal \\ \hline
    $r$ & A human is mortal
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \oplus q, \neg p \vdash q$
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Truth Tables}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $p$ & $q$ & $p \rightarrow q$ & $p \wedge q$ & $p \vee q$ 
    & $p \oplus q$ & $p \equiv q$ & $\neg p$\\
    \hline
    &   & if & and & or &  XOR & iff & not  \\
    \hline
    T & T & T & T & T & F & T & F \\ 
    T & F & F & F & T & T & F & F \\  
    F & T & T & F & T & T & F & T\\ 
    F & F & T & F & F & F & T & T\\ \hline
%    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Words themselves often carry more implications
    \\ \eng{I did A and B} often implies \eng{I did A first}
  \item There are many ways of saying the operations
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}



\myslide{Quantification and Negation}
\begin{itemize} \addtolength{\itemsep}{-1em} 
\item We can restrict the scope of statements with quantifiers
\item We can change the polarity of statements using negation
\item These interact with each other in interesting ways
\item These interact with language in interesting ways
\item We use quantifiers for explicit representation of scope ambiguity
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Everyone doesn't love semantics}
    \begin{xlist}
          \ex \eng{It is not the case that all people love semantics}:  
          \\ $\neg\forall$x (L(x,s))
          \ex \eng{All people have the property of not loving semantics}: 
          \\ $\forall$x($\neg$L(x,s))
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}
\item Negative Polarity Items
 \begin{exe}
   \ex \eng{Few people have eaten dessert \ul{yet}} vs 
   \eng{I \ul{still} have not eaten desert} 
\ex \eng{Rarely does Kim \ul{ever} eat dessert} vs
\eng{Kim \ul{often} eats dessert}
 \end{exe}
 
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Connotation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Many words carry more meaning than just identifying their referent.
\begin{exe}
  \ex
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex \eng{Kim is slender}
    \ex \eng{Kim is thin}
    \ex \eng{Kim is haggard}
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\item Sentiment can be built up.
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{good}
    \ex \eng{very good}
    \ex \eng{less than very good}
    \ex \eng{I have never found it to be less than very good}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}



\section{Word Meaning Revisited}

\myslide{Defining Meaning}

\begin{itemize}
\item When we use a word, we don't have to know everything about the
  referent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A \eng{dog-cart} is a kind of \con{cart}
  \item[\ent] you can ride it
  \item[\ent] it has wheels
  \end{itemize}
\item We infer that it has many of the same properties as its
  \txx{hypernym}, even though it may not have all
 \begin{itemize}
  \item A \eng{hover-car} is a kind of \con{car}
  \item[\ent] you can ride it
  \item[$\not\Rightarrow$] it has wheels
  \end{itemize}
\item Many of the properties may be irrelevant to the story at hand,
  and irrelevant to the syntax of the language
\end{itemize}

\myslide{How do we learn?}

\begin{quote}
  \textit{You shall know a word by the company it keeps} \hfill
\citep[p11]{Firth:1957}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item You see a new word \emp{in context}
\\ \eng{buttoning up his \ul{pea-jacket}, }
\item And you deduce information from the context

\begin{itemize}
\item[?] it is a kind of jacket \hfill(\eng{yellow jacket}?)
\item[?] with buttons
\item [?] it is thick material (they are going to a stake out)
\item[?] it has something to do with peas \\ $\times$ not true (from the West
  Frisian word \eng{pijjakker}, in which \eng{pij} referred to the
  type of cloth used, a coarse kind of \ul{twilled} blue cloth)
\end{itemize}
\item We are getting better at doing this with computers
\begin{itemize}
\item but people don't just use words
\item they have eyes and noses and other senses, \\ and they have brains
  that link things
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\myslide{How else do we learn?}

\begin{itemize}
\item From word internal cues
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng[far vision]{Television} 
  \item \eng[internet phone]{iphone} 
    (also \eng{individual, instruct, inform, inspire} from the \lex{iMac})
  \item 鯖 \jpn[mackerel]{saba} = 魚 fish; 青 blue
  \end{itemize}
\item From the sound
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{bouba/kiki}  $\star$ or $\clubsuit$
  \item \eng{banged, beaten, battered, bruised, blistered, bashed}
  \item mouth shape for \eng{teeny weeny} vs \eng{large}
  \end{itemize}
\item From  images:
  \begin{tabular}[t]{c}
\includegraphics[width=5em]{pics/magnifying-glass} \\    
 \eng{Magnifying Glass} 
  \end{tabular}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Words are related in many other ways}


\begin{itemize}
\item Domains: \eng{ball, racket, net, love, ace}
\item Origin: \eng{chew, eat, drink} vs \eng{masticate, consume, imbibe}
\item[?] come up with some words with different origins\task 
  \\ English or another language!
\item Dialect: \eng{ripper, bonza, sickie, no worries}
\item Part-of-speech: \eng{die, live} vs \eng{death, life}
\item When you learned them!
\item and many more
\end{itemize}

All of these relations affect how you use and understand language.
  
\section{Constructions and Idioms}

\myslide{Beyond words and phrases}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some uses of language seem to come from beyond just the words
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{They laughed the poor guy out of the room.}
  \item \eng{Mary urged Bill into the house.}
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Caused Motion Construction}
  \\ CAUSE-MOVE $<$agent, theme, goal/path$>$ \into S V NP PP
  \begin{itemize}
  \item compatible verbs can fuse with the construction
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Xer the Yer}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{the more you think about it, the less you understand}
  \end{itemize}
\item At one end, phrases can be modeled as very general constructions
\item At the other end, idioms can be modeled as very specific constructions
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Idioms}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some expressions clearly involve more than one orthographic word
  \begin{itemize}
  \item compound noun
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \eng{grass snake}; \eng{grass and tree snakes}
    \end{itemize}
  \item verb-particle
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \eng{I looked it up} vs \eng{I looked up the very long word}
    \end{itemize}
  \item  idiom
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \eng{going great guns, give the Devil his due}
    \item \eng{jog someone's memory}
    \item \eng{blow one's top}
    \end{itemize}
\item And more
\\ \eng{San Francisco, ad hoc, by and large, Where Eagles
Dare, kick the bucket, part of speech, in step, the
Oakland Raiders, trip the light fantastic, telephone
box,  take a walk , do a number on
(someone), take (unfair) advantage (of), pull strings,
kindle excitement, fresh air, \ldots}
  \end{itemize}
\item Knowing the individual words is not enough to know the meaning (or usage)
  
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Multiword Expressions (MWE)}

There are many different kinds of irregularity.

\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
  MWE & \multicolumn{5}{c}{Weirdness} \\
                  & Lexical  & Syntactic & Semantic & Pragmatic &
                                                                  Statistical  \\
\hline
\eng{ad hominem}       &  $+$ & ?   &  ?   &   ?   & $+$ \\
\eng{at first}          &      & $+$ &     &      & ? \\
\eng{first aid}         &      &      & $+$   &      & ? \\
\eng{salt and pepper}   &      &      &      &      & $+$\\
\eng{good morning}      &      &      &      &  $+$ &$+$ \\
\eng{cat's cradle}     & $+$  &      &  $+$ &      & ?\\
\end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most of the time, we don't even notice
\item Unless it is your second language
\item In Project Three you will find examples of interesting
  multi-word expressions
\\ from a new story
\end{itemize}

\myslide{How common are MWEs?}

\begin{itemize}
\item They are very common in the lexicon
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In wordnet,  41\% of the entries are multiword (mainly compound nouns)
  \end{itemize}
\item But less common in the actual text (\sh{SPEC} 4.5\%: 296/6,641)
\\ 24 are new (not in Wordnet 3.0); 55 are named entities

% w	as well as	w	1

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{take into one's confidence}
  \item \eng{take in}
  \item \eng{Sherlock Holmes}
  \item \eng{practical joke(r)}
  \item \eng{in love}
  \item \eng{get the better of}
  \item \eng{Panama hat}
  \item \eng{as good as one's word} 
  \end{itemize}
\item It still seems as though we are missing many MWEs
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Why are they important?}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you think you know the individual words, then you might be  confused

\item  Which is a problem if you are a translator:
\\ \eng[whoever he met]{whoever crossed his path} \sh{SPEC}
\begin{exe}
  \ex \glll 私道 を 渡ろう と する 人 \\
  shidou wo watarou to suru hito \\
  private-road \textsc{acc} cross.let's \textsc{quot} do person \\
\trans ''whoever tried to cross his private road''
\end{exe}
\item Knowledge of MWEs is one of the things that separates a good speaker from a poor one
\item From a linguist's point of view, they also reveal something about
  how language is organized in our brains
\end{itemize}

\item ChatGPT:
\texttt{The English idiom "Kim blew her top" translates to Japanese as "キムはキレた" (Kimu wa kireta). This phrase captures the sense that Kim lost her temper or became very angry.}
\item FCB: What does "キムは頭に来た" mean
\item ChatGPT:  \texttt{The phrase "キムは頭に来た" (Kimu wa atama ni kita) translates to English as "Kim got angry" or more literally, "It came to Kim's head." It's another way to express that Kim became angry or upset, similar to saying "Kim blew her top" in English. \\
The expression  "頭に 来た" (atama ni kita) is a common way in Japanese to describe someone getting angry or frustrated.}

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar is a theory of grammar
%     with several desirable properties
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item \txx{Mono-stratal}: Orthography, Syntax, Semantics,
%       Pragmatics are are all handled in a single structure (the
%       {\smaller \txx{SIGN}})
%     \item \txx{Constraint-based}: parses are built up compositionally,
%       with new information constraining the range of interpretations
%     \item \txx{Lexicalist}: Word structure and phrase structure are
%       governed by partly independent principles. Words and phrases are
%       two kinds (subtypes) of sign.  Lexical information is organized
%       in terms of multiple inheritance hierarchies and lexical rules
%       that allow complex properties of words to be derived from the
%       logic of the lexicon.
%     \item \txx{Constructionist}: Constructions (phrase-rules) are also
%       modeled as feature structures. This allows constructions to be
%       analyzed via multiple inheritance hierarchies: modeling the fact
%       that constructions cluster into groups with a `family
%       resemblance' that corresponds to a constraint on a common
%       supertype.

\section{Metaphors}
\myslide{Metaphors and Mechanisms of Interpretation}

A metaphor is an extension of the use of a word beyond its
primary meaning to describe referents that bear similarities to
the word's primary referent.
\begin{itemize}
\item \lex{eye} ``body part used for vision''
  \begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{dull end of a needle (with a hole for the thread)} 
  \raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[width=3em]{pics/needle}}    
  \ex \eng{the bud on a potato}
\raisebox{-2ex}{\includegraphics[width=3em]{pics/potato}}     
  \ex \eng{the centre of a storm} \raisebox{-4ex}{\includegraphics[width=10em]{pics/eye-of-storm}}
  \end{exe}
\item The similarities between these referents and the primary referent of
the word \lex{eye} are their roundish shape and their more or less central
location on a larger shape.
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Grammaticalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item Once a metaphor becomes accepted, speakers tend to view the
metaphorical meaning as separated from its primary meaning

\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{booking a flight}
  \ex \eng{tabling a motion}
  \ex \eng{seeing the point}
  \ex \eng{stealing the headlines}
  \ex \eng{buying time}
\end{exe}
\item These are \txx{dead metaphors}: we don't need to specially process them
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Metaphors as non-prototypical use}

\begin{itemize}
\item In a way, metaphors are non-prototypical uses of a word.
\begin{itemize}
\item Humans understand words by referring to a prototypical usage,
and they match a new example against the characteristics of the
prototype.
\item  Use of words with broken typicality conditions happens all the
time.
\end{itemize}
\item
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{The price of brussel sprouts went up.}
    \ex \eng{Marigold is coming out of a coma.}
    \ex \eng{Felix is under age.}
    \ex \eng{I killed his argument.}
    \ex \eng{Their love affair is blossoming.}
    \ex \eng{She has a fertile imagination.}
  \end{exe}
\item However, depending on how you count frozen metaphors, 
we may use metaphors more than literal uses!
\end{itemize}

\end{flushright}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cognitive semantics:
\\ There is no separation between cognition and
linguistic knowledge
\item Features of Metaphor
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Conventional}: some metaphors are very well established 
\\ (but remain metaphorical)
\item \txx{Systematic}: understood as part of larger domains
\item \txx{Asymmetrical}: normally understand the \emp{abstract} 
  in terms of the \emp{concrete}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\myslide{\textit{Metaphors We Live By}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in
language but in thought and action.
\item Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we
both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in
nature.
\item If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system
is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we
experience, and what we do every day is very much a
matter of metaphor.
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Prototypical metaphors}

Some metaphors are not as good as others because not all broken typicality
conditions result in prototypical metaphors. What is a prototypical
metaphor?

\begin{itemize}
\item Similarity and dissimilarity have both been stressed.
\item Items must not be too similar:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{$^\#$Wine is whisky}
    \ex \eng{$^\#$Cars are trucks}
    \ex \eng{$^\#$Jam is honey}
  \end{exe}
\newpage
\item They should not be too dissimilar:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{His feet were stars}
    \ex \eng{Her cheeks were typewriters}
    \ex \eng{Her knees were penguins}
  \end{exe}
\item In a prototypical metaphor then, items compared are
likely to come from different lexical fields but they are
also similar in that they do share some minor
characteristic. Dissimilarity signals the listener to do
some active semantic matching.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{Life is a subway train}
  \ex \eng{Men are thistles}
  \ex \eng{He posted the toast down to his stomach}
\end{exe}

\ex \eng{If you use that strategy, he'll wipe you out.}
\ex \eng{He shot down all my arguments.}
\ex \eng{He was defeated by the argument.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item We don't just talk about argument in terms of war. We can actually win or
lose arguments.
\item  Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war.
Though there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent.
  \item  We attack their positions and defend our own.
  \item  We gain and lose ground.
  \item  We plan and use strategies.
 \end{itemize}

\item The metaphor is not only in the words we use --- it is in our very concept of argument.  We talk about arguments that way because we conceive of them that way --- and we
act according to the way we conceive of things
\item But we could think of an argument as a search for truth, \ldots
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Argument: When losing is winning}
\MyLogo{\url{http://www.humansinvent.com/\#!/13260/argument-when-losing-is-winning/}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Leo Kent (2013) argues that the argument as war metaphor is counterproductive
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose you and I have an argument. You believe a proposition, P, and I don't. I've objected, I've questioned, I've raised all sorts of counter-considerations, and in every case you've responded to my satisfaction. At the end of the day, I say, ‘You know what? I guess you're right.'
  \item So I have a new belief. And it's not just any belief, but it's a well-articulated, examined and battle-tested belief.
  \item So who won that argument? Well, the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won, even though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain.
  \item The war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost, even though I gained and there's something wrong with that picture.

\MyLogo{\textit{Backs to the Future} \url{http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/soc/backsfuture06.asp}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Spatial metaphors} have to do with
spatial orientation: \lex{up-down, in-out, front-back, on-off, deep-shallow, 
central-peripheral}.

\item Spatial metaphors give a concept a spatial orientation eg.
HAPPY is UP: \eng{I'm feeling up today}
\item Though polar oppositions \eng{up-down, in-out} are physical in nature, the spatial
metaphors based on them can vary from culture to culture. (e.g. in most 
cultures FUTURE is FRONT but in at least one FUTURE is BACK)
\begin{itemize}

% \item     Morality: The basis of morality is in understanding, respecting, and helping other people, and in seeking the happiness of one's self and of others. The primary vices are selfishness and anti-social behavior.
% \item   Child development: Children develop morality primarily through interacting with and observing good people, especially good parents. Punishment is necessary in some cases, but also has the potential to backfire, causing children to adopt more violent or more anti-social ways. Though children should, in general, obey their parents, they will develop best if allowed to question their parents' decisions. Moral development is a life-long process, and almost no one is so perfect as not to need improvement.
% \item     Justice: The world is not without justice, but it is far from the ideal of justice. Many people, for example, do not seem properly rewarded for their hard work and dedication. We must work hard to improve everyone's condition.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item     Morality: Evil is all around us, constantly tempting us. Thus, the basis of morality is strong moral character, which requires self-reliance and self-discipline. The primary vices are those that dissolve self-discipline, such as laziness, gluttony, and indulgent sexuality.
% \item     Child development: Children develop self-discipline, self-reliance, and other virtues primarily through rewards and punishment, a system of "tough love". Since parents know the difference between right and wrong and children still do not, obedience to the parents is very important. Moral development basically lasts only as long as childhood; it's important to get it right the first time, because there is no "second chance".
% \item 
%     Justice: The world may be a difficult place to live, but it is basically just; people usually get what they deserve. The difficulties in one's life serve as a test to sort the deserving from the undeserving.

\myslide{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item We can combine words in non-compositional ways
\item But still there are shared conventions
\item Some things we have to learn (\txx{idioms}), some things we work out
  on the fly (\txx{metaphors})
\item The distinction is somewhat fuzzy

\section{More Metaphor: Anger}

\myslide{ANGER}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item Emotions are often considered to be feelings alone, and
as such they are viewed as being devoid of conceptual
content.
\item In fact emotions have a fairly complex conceptual
structure which can be studied through metaphors.
\item Lakoff and Johnson's cultural model of anger
\\ Physiological effects of anger:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Increased body heat
  \item Increased internal pressure
  \item Agitation
  \item Interference with accurate perception
  \item As anger increases, the physiological effect increases
  \item There is a limit beyond which the physiological effects of anger impair normal functioning.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Body heat:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Don't get hot under the collar.}
    \ex \eng{Billy's a hothead.}
    \ex \eng{They were having a heated argument.}
    \ex \eng{She got all hot and bothered.}
  \end{exe}
  \item Internal pressure:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{When I found out, I almost burst a blood vessel.}
    \ex \eng{He almost had a hemorrhage.}
    \ex \eng{I exploded at them.}
  \end{exe}
\newpage
\item Redness in the face and neck area:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{She was scarlet with rage.}
    \ex \eng{He got red with anger.}
    \ex \eng{He was flushed with anger.}
  \end{exe}
\item Agitation
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{She was shaking with anger.}
  \ex \eng{I was hopping mad.}
  \ex \eng{He was quivering with rage.}
  \ex \eng{He's all worked up.}
 \ex \eng{She's all wrought up.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item Interference with accurate perception
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{She was blind with rage.}
  \ex \eng{I was beginning to see red.}
  \ex \eng{I was so mad I couldn't see straight.}
\end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{ANGER is HEAT}

\begin{itemize}
\item ANGER is HEAT forms the basis of the most
  general metaphor for anger
\item There are two versions to this metaphor,
  one where the heat is applied to fluid and
  the other where the heat is applied to
  solids.
\item The fluid version is more elaborated
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The body is a container for the emotions
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{He was filled with anger.}
  \ex \eng{She couldn't contain her joy.}
  \ex \eng{She was brimming with rage.}
  \ex \eng{Try to get the anger out of your system.}
\end{exe}
\item
The ANGER is HEAT metaphor when applied to fluids combines with the
metaphor the body is a container for the emotions to yield the central
metaphor of the system:
\item ANGER is HEAT OF A FLUID in a container.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{You make my blood boil.}
  \ex \eng{Simmer down!}
  \ex \eng{I had reached the boiling point.}
  \ex \eng{Let him stew.}
  \ex \eng{She was seething with rage.}
\end{exe}

\item Similarly \lex{pissed off} is used only to refer to anger --- ``hot liquid under
pressure''
\item Cool and calm corresponds to the lack of anger.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{Keep cool.}
  \ex \eng{Stay calm.}
\end{exe}

\item When The Intensity Of Anger Increases The Fluid Rises
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{His pent-up anger welled up inside him.}
  \ex \eng{She could feel her gorge rising.}
  \ex \eng{We got a rise out of him.}
  \ex \eng{My anger kept building up inside me.}
  \ex \eng{Pretty soon I was in a towering rage.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item We also know that intense heat produces steam and creates pressure on the
container. This yields the metaphorical entailments:
\item Intense Anger Produces Pressure On The Container
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{He was bursting with anger.}
    \ex \eng{I could barely contain my rage.}
    \ex \eng{I could barely keep it in any more.}
    \ex \eng{He suppressed his anger.}
    \ex \eng{He turned his anger inward.}
    \ex \eng{He managed to keep his anger bottled up inside him.}
    \ex \eng{He was blue in the face.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item  When the pressure on the container becomes too high, the container explodes.
\item When Anger Becomes Too Intense The Person Explodes
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{When I told him, he just exploded.}
  \ex \eng{She blew up at me.}
  \ex \eng{We don't like your outbursts.}
  \ex \eng{She blew a fuse.}
  \ex \eng{He blew a gasket.}
  \ex \eng{He erupted.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item When A Person Explodes, Parts Of Them Go Up In The Air.
  \begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{I blew my stack.}
  \ex \eng{I blew my top.}
  \ex \eng{She flipped her lid.}
  \ex \eng{He hit the ceiling.}
  \ex \eng{I went through the roof.}
\end{exe}

\newpage

\item The central metaphor of Anger as heated fluid in a container indicate
that the anger scale is not open-ended, it has a limit. Just as hot
fluid in a closed container can only take so much heat before it
explodes, so we conceptualise the anger scale as having a limit
point. We can only bear so much anger before we explode.
\item The conceptual metaphors are motivated by our own physiology.
\item There may be cross-cultural differences
\item And there are many possible metaphors

\begin{itemize}
\item ANGER is FIRE
\item ANGER is INSANITY
\item ANGER is an OPPONENT
\item ANGER is a DANGEROUS ANIMAL
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
