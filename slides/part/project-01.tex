\begin{itemize}
\item[1] Identify and annotate word meaning for your own passage of
  one of the stories using wordnet as the sense inventory: 2-4 people do
  the same set of sentences.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For every word that needs to be tagged, either
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Chose a sense in wordnet
    \item Identify it as a named entity
    \item Identify a problem in the corpus or wordnet
      \\ and leave a comment saying what the it should be
    \end{itemize}
  \item Do this on your own --- the goal is to think about the words' meanings
  \end{itemize}
\framebreak
\item[2] Compare and contrast your annotations with other annotators;
  re-annotate based on your discussion and leave comments for at least
  five words.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We expect you to disagree 30-40\% of the time (more often than experts)
  \item Sometimes you will have made a careless mistake
  \item Sometimes you will have interpreted wordnet differently
  \item Sometimes you will have interpreted the passage differently
  \item Discussing meaning deepens your understanding of it
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
