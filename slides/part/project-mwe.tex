\begin{itemize}
\item Be aware of multiword expressions when you analyze the text
\item There should be, on average, one in every two sentences
\item We expect around 20\% to be missing from Wordnet!  
\item If they are not already in the wordnet, add them in the comment
  \\ you only have to comment on the first word
\end{itemize}
