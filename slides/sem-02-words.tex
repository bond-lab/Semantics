\section{Introduction to Semantics}

\begin{frame}{What is Semantics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Very broadly, semantics is the study of meaning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Word meaning
  \item Sentence meaning
  \item Contextual meaning (pragmatics)
  \end{itemize}
\item Why do we want to study meaning?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It underlies our understanding of the world
  \item It is fundamental to our thinking, but we don't consciously know what we are doing
  \end{itemize}
\item What kind of knowledge does it take for a speaker to produce language and for a hearer to comprehend language? 
\end{itemize}
\begin{taskb}
  Please tell me why you want to study lexical semantics, what languages you know, how much semantics you know already and how much programming you have done, \ldots
\end{taskb}

\begin{quotation}
  
Japanese traffic lights are green (as required by international
agreements).  However they are typically called 青い \jpn[blue]{aoi},
the same word as the color of the sky.  Historically this color
historically covered both green and blue ``grue'',
with 緑 \jpn[green]{midori} being a later addition.  For this reason,
the Japanese government decided in 1973 to change the color of the go
light to the bluest possible hue of green!

\begin{frame}{Word Meaning and Sentence Meaning}

\begin{itemize}
\item We store information about words in our \txx{mental lexicon}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It is still unclear what exactly a word is!
  \end{itemize}
\item Words can be combined to form an infinite number of expressions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This building up of meaning is referred to as \txx{composition}
  \item If the meaning of the whole can be deduced from the parts then it is \txx{compositional}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reference and Sense}

\begin{itemize}
\item Words \txx{refer} to things in the world (like \iz{unicorn}s)
\item The meaning of a word across different contexts is often referred to as its \txx{sense}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Same word can refer to different things
    \begin{itemize}
    \item English: \eng{I put my money in the \ul{bank}}
    \item English: \eng{I fell asleep at the river \ul{bank}}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Same basic concept can have different boundaries
    \begin{itemize}
    \item French: \eng[sheep/mutton]{mouton}
    \item English: \eng{sheep} vs \eng{mutton}
      
    \item Japanese: \eng[dove/pigeon]{hato}
    \item English: \eng{dove} vs \eng{pigeon}

\begin{frame}{Representing meaning}
\MyLogo{Also vector space, description, images, video, \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item One of our goals will be to represent meaning
\item There are various ways to do this
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Syntactic trees
  \item Logical forms
  \item Thesauri and Ontologies 
  \item Translation
  \item Paraphrasing
  \end{itemize}
Can you think of others?

\item At the end of this course you should be able to use these to
  describe many aspects of word meaning

      \textbf{tailor} = \eng{a \textcolor{blue}{person} whose \textcolor{brown}{occupation is making and altering garments}}
    \end{quote}
  \item Definitions are conventionally made up of;
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{genus}: what class the lexical item belongs to
    \item \textcolor{brown}{differentiae}: what attributes distinguish it from
      other members of that class

  \item familiarity (we are taught to use dictionaries)

\item Cons:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item subjectivity in sense granularity (splitters vs.\ lumpers) and

\section{Lexical Semantics}

\begin{frame}{Lexical Semantics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical semantics is concerned with the identification and
  representation of the semantics of lexical items
\item If we are to identify the semantics of lexical items, we have to
  be prepared for the eventuality of a given word having 
  multiple interpretations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{Polysemy}: having multiple meanings
  \item \txx{Monosemy}: having only one meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item \txx{Homonyms} are words with two unrelated meanings:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{homographs}: same spelling 
    \\ \eng{bow} vs \eng{bow}; \eng{keep} vs \eng{keep}
  \item \txx{homophones}: same pronunciation
     \\ \eng{right} vs \eng{write}; \eng{keep} vs \eng{keep}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Polysemy} = the condition of a single lexical item having
%   multiple meanings
% \item Polysemy vs.\ homonymy (cf.\ \eng{bank} vs.\ \eng{bass})
% \item Polysemy vs.\ indeterminacy (cf.\ \eng{father} vs.\ \eng{uncle})
% \item Regular/logical vs.\ irregular polysemy (cf.\ \eng{ash})
% \item Regular vs.\ complementary polysemy (cf.\ \eng{door} vs.\ \eng{farm})
% \end{itemize}

%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Distinguishing Polysemes}

%The polysemy of a word can be tested by a variety of means, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Antagonism}: can the word be used in a sentence with
  multiple \underline{competing} interpretations that are incompatible? \\[1ex]
  \eng{Kim can't  bear children}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cannot have children
  \item Doesn't like children
  \end{itemize}
\item \txx{Zeugma}: can the word be used in a context where multiple
  \underline{competing} interpretations are simultaneously evoked? \\[1ex]
  \eng{Kim and her visa expired}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item died
    \item ran out
    \end{itemize}
 \eng{Hitmen were quite expensive, so she decided to take out a loan and her husband.} \task

\item These are \txx{intrinsic}, \txx{generic} properties
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An albino zebra with three legs is still a zebra
  \end{itemize}
\item Can we use words even if we don't know their properties?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{Kway Teow}
  \end{itemize}
\item We seem to be ok with fairly vague definitions
  \begin{taskb}

\begin{frame}{Synonymy}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Propositional synonymy}: X is a propositional synonym of Y if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item   (i) X and Y are syntactically identical,
  \item (ii) substitution of Y  for X in a declarative sentence doesn't change its truth conditions
  \end{itemize}
  e.g., \lex{violin} and \lex{fiddle}
\item Why propositional synonymy is over-restrictive:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item syntactic identity (cf.\ \lex{eat} and \lex{devour})
  \item collocations (cf.\ \lex{cemetery} and \lex{graveyard})
  \item gradability (cf.\ \lex{sofa}/\lex{settee} vs.\ \lex{boundary/frontier})
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Near Synonymy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Near synonyms are substitutable in \textbf{some/most} rather than \textbf{all} contexts
\item Synonymy via semantics: synonyms share ``common traits'' or
  attributional overlap, walking the fine line between ``necessary
  resemblances'' and ``permissible differences'':
  \begin{quote}
      \lex{grain} vs. \lex{granule};  \lex{green} vs.\ \lex{purple}; \lex{alsation} vs. \lex{spaniel}
  \end{quote}
\item Permissible differentiation via \textbf{clarification}.
  \begin{quote}
    \eng{Here is a \underline{grain}, or \underline{granule}, of the substance.}\\
    \eng{* The cover is \underline{green}, \{or, that is to say\} \underline{purple}.}
    \\   \eng{* He likes alsations, in other words, \underline{spaniels}}
    
  \end{quote}
%   and \textbf{contrast}:
%   \begin{quote}
%     \eng{Here is a \underline{grain} or, more exactly, \underline{granule}}\\
%     \eng{* He likes alsations, or more exactly, \underline{spaniels}}
%   \end{quote}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Properties of synonymy}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Symmetric
  \item traditionally applies only to lexical items of the same word class
    \\ but pairs like \lex{can} vs \lex{be able to} suggest otherwise
  \item applied at the sense level
  \item $\approx$ converse of polysemy

\item Assume \cmp{+parent}(x,y)  means ``x is the parent of y''
\item There are various ways you can formalize such relationships

  % \item We did this for demonstratives
  %   \\ \lex{this, that, these, those, what, here, there, where}\task

\begin{itemize}
\item Represent words as a vector of numbers (instead of a set of components)
\item Every word has a unique word embedding (or “vector”), which is
  just a list of numbers for each word.  
\item Embeddings start being useful from 50-500 dimensions
  \\ LLMs typically are much larger
\item The embedding captures the  “meaning” of the word. 
\item  Similar words end up with similar embedding values
\item Context based word embeddings give a different vector depending
  on the context
