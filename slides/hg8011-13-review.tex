And so, reader, farewell to Sherlock Holmes! I thank you for your past constancy, and can but hope that some return has been made in the shape of that distraction from the worries of life and stimulating change of thought which can only be found in the fairy kingdom of romance.
\\ \mbox{} \hfill Arthur Conan Doyle (Preface to \href{http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/canon/case.html}{The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes})

Only years of practice will teach you the mysteries and bold certainty of a real gardener, who treads at random, yet tramples on nothing.
