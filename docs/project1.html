    <h3>HG8011: Projects 1 and 2</h3>


    <!-- <h6>Welcome to the NTU Multilingual Corpus Tools!</h6> -->

<h4><a name='phase1'>Project 1 (Individual: 20%) pass/fail</a></h4>  

<ul>

  <li>If you have not yet done so, read all of chapter 1.
   
  <li>Tag all words that need to be tagged in the sentences assigned to you.
    <br>You can find your name in the list below
    <ul>
      <li> For each word you should chose one of the senses in wordnet
	(Fellbaum 1998) or indicate why this is not possible.
      <li>If you think it is marked for <a href='https://bond-lab.github.io/IMI/guide/sentiment.html'>sentiment</a>, you should note its
	polarity and strength
      <li> There is a <a href='https://bond-lab.github.io/IMI/guide/'>quick start guide</a>.
	
      <li> More detailed instructions are given in
	the <a href='https://bond-lab.github.io/IMI/tagdoc.html'>Detailed Tagging Guidelines</a>
	<li> You can <a href='https://compling.upol.cz/ntumc/cgi-bin/check-class.cgi'>check your progress here</a>. 
      <li>The tool works best under Chrome or Firefox.
    <br><strong>If you log in but it does not remember you, please use
    incognito mode!</strong>  There is an issue with cookies that we
    have not been able to fix.
      <li>You will be assessed on
	<ul>
	  <li>Completion: is everything tagged
	  <li>Accuracy: are the tags reasonable (do they agree more
	    than a threshold with an expert annotation)
	  <li><a href='annotation.html#phase1.html'>Your assigned sentences are here</a>
	  <li>If you have tagged everything reasonably accurately then you will pass
	</ul>
    </ul>
  <li> Estimated time 3-5 hours (but it may take longer).  Don't overthink things.
  <li> <b>You should have annotated every word by the due date.</b>  It is
      important you make this deadline so that we can merge the data
      for part 2.
  <li>Comment words where you are not sure of the tag
  <li>The due date is on the <a href='index.html'>main page</a>
</ul>

<h4><a name='phase2'>Project 2 (Group: 20%)</a></h4>  

<ul>
  <li> After the task is completed, you will be given a comparison of
    your tags with those of other annotators and a merged corpus with
    the majority tags tagged.
  <li> You should discuss any differences as a group
  (<a href='annotation.html#phase2'>see your group</a>).
  <li> You should re-tag any words on which all three of you
    disagreed, or on which you changed your mind.
  <li>You should add comments for
    <ul>
      <li>Anything marked 'e', with suggestions as to how to fix the corpus
      <li>Anything marked 'w', with suggestions as to how to fix
	wordnet
	<li> If the same word appears many times with the same issue,
	you only need to comment on the <strong>first</strong> occurence 
    </ul>
    
  <li>Note that the final annotator is a naive computer
    &mdash; it just tags most frequent sense (mfs)
    <ul>
      <li>mfs is calculated from the semcor corpus and three Sherlock
	Holmes Stories (DANC, SPEC and REDH) weighted 1:3 to normalize frequencies
      <li>Unseen proper nouns are tagged as <tt>per</tt>
      <li>Unseen closed class words are tagged as <tt>x</tt>
      <li>Unseen monosemous words are tagged with their single sense
      <li>Other unseen words are tagged <tt>None</tt>
      <li>If there are two or more equally frequent senses for a lemma
	then it is tagged <tt>None</tt>
    </ul>
  <li>So feel free to over-ride them!
   <li> Estimated time for re-annotation is 2-3 hours.  Don't overthink things.
   <li>Then write a short paper:
      <ul>
  <li> In the write up you should describe the strengths and weaknesses 
    of using a lexical resource such as wordnet to define word meaning
    <ul>
      <li> Are the senses in wordnet too coarse, too fine or just right?  
	Justify your position.
    </ul>
  <li> You should give concrete examples from the text you analyzed.
  Some things you could discuss include:
    <ul>
    <li> Were some words easier or harder to annotate than others?
      <ul>
	<li> e.g. verbs, multiword expressions, concrete nouns, …
      </ul>
    <li> In cases where you disagreed with other annotators, on
    reflection, do you think: you were right; they were right; the
    definition is bad; or is there some other reason?
    </ul>
  <li> For words with senses missing in wordnet, you should write a
  comment with enough information to create a new entry for them
  consisting of, at minimum, a definition, a relational link to an
  existing synset and an example. E.g.  
    <ul>
      <li> Lemma: arrow
      <li> Def: To assign a task to someone. Generally used only if the task is unpleasant or boring.
      <li> Ex: They come and arrow me type their document
      <li> Hyponym of: delegate (02391803-v)
    </ul>
    Don't actually create a new synset (with <b>the</b> edit or <b>add
    a new synset</b> button), just write in the comments (and paper).
  <li> You don't need an extensive literature review, but you should
    read and cite  the references below and  if you
    consult other lexicons (which you are encouraged to do) then you
    should cite them.  You should also cite the wordnet you used and
    the story you tagged.

  <li> You should discuss how long it took you to do the
  annotation, and if you think there would be ways to make the task
    quicker or easier.
    <li> Submit  <b>softcopy</b> (via moodle).  Only one person from each group
    needs to submit.
    <li>The paper should be six to eight pages, excluding references.
      You should not include any appendices: everything should fit within
      the paper.
      </ul>
  <li> The deadline is on the main page.</b>.  
</ul>

<h3>Rubric</h3>

<p>You will be marked 50% on the annotation:  (i) completeness (did you annotate every word), (ii) accuracy (did you select an appropriate meaning) and (iii) recall (did you only annotate words for sentiment that are not neutral) and (iv) quality of explanation (did you provide an informative explanation for every word you tagged as ‘e’ or ‘w’). The remaining 50% will be on the write up.  Criteria to grade the write up include 1) language and style of the paper, 2) quality of selection of examples, 3) quality of the analysis of the data, 4) quality of discussion and conclusions, 5) overall organization and unity.
