I did not add the computational annotator this year, as there was not data for Czech to calculate most frequent sense.   Next year, I will, based on this year's data!

However for one group (English 110113-110130), there was only one student who completed the task.  I therefore added the computational annotator as annotator D: treat tem as a not-very good annotator, feel free to disagree with them.   If you want to discuss any issues, you can discuss them with me. 

The following students did not complete the annotation (and thus failed this assignment):

s3
s47
s77
s78
s79
s85
s86
s94
s96
s99
s103
s105
s115
s121  (tags filled in by computer).
